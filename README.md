## Description
{ We have often found ourselves spending over 30 minutes queuing at a supermarket outlet waiting on cashiers to ring up peoples multitudinous items.Most people end up leaving the supermarket or not entering it entirely.This has led to alot of revenue loss by the retailers; So we have come with a website which allows users to book the goods they want before even getting to the supermarket outlet.The user will book and pay for the items and when he/she goes to the outlet, the desired items will have been packed and ready for pickup.This will be beneficial to both parties as the user will save time and energy whilst the supermarket retaining its revenue.
